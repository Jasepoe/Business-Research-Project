Working from the perspective of a analyst at an investment bank, My team wants to understand how it should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage backed securites. 

My task is look into factors that are driving home prices. 

Using my knowlege of Descriptive statistics and data analyisis I was able to identify several diffrent factors that correlate with the pricing of homes.

With these insights I have created a presentation that shows what factors are more likely to increase home prices and what factors don't have much of an effect, helping stakeholders decide where they should invest.
