# Business-Research-Project

Working from the perspective of an analyst at an investment bank, My team wants to understand how it should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage backed securites. 

My task is look into factors that are driving home prices. 

Using my knowlege of Descriptive statistics and data analysis, I was able to identify several different factors that correlate with the pricing of homes.

Taking a small subset of homes along with data about there pricing and features, I chose 3 diffrent elements of the homes I believed to be important. Using descripitve statistics in excel, I was able to determine with a 10% margin of error that homes with these features will sell at the predicted amount

For the scope of this project, I only looked into 3 factors; however this method can be implemented at any scale if needed. This project will translate well in any role where I would need to predict future outcomes of products are services.
